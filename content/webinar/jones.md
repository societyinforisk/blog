>**Presentation abstract:**

>Modeling "how much risk" is only part of the challenge. In fact it's just one input to the broader challenge of managing risk effectively over time. In this session, Jack will provide a FAIR view of this broader risk landscape context.

Mr. Jones has been employed in technology for the past twenty-seven years, and has specialized in information security and risk management for nineteen years. During this time, he’s worked in the United States military, government intelligence, consulting, as well as the financial and insurance industries. Mr. Jones has over seven years of experience as a CISO, with five of those years at a Fortune 100 financial services company. His work there was recognized in 2006 when he received the 2006 ISSA Excellence in the Field of Security Practices award at that year’s RSA conference. He is also the author and creator of the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) framework.

In 2007, Mr. Jones was selected as a finalist for the Information Security Executive of the Year, Central United States, and judged the national Information Security Executive of the Year competition. From 2008 to 2009 he was an invited member of an international task force convened by ISACA to develop a standard framework for risk management, now referred to as RiskIT.

Mr. Jones’ company, Risk Management Insight LLC, helps companies to manage risk cost-effectively through accurate and meaningful quantitative risk analysis.
