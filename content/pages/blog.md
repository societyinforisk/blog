There are three "blogs" at SIRA:

- the Society & site news feed on the main page
- the official Society [blog](/stg/category/blog.html)
- the Society's [risk blog aggregator](/stg/category/riskblog.html)

**You** can blog on SIRA by creating a "risk" Atom or RSS feed from your existing blog and submit it to us for consideration.

### Blogging with SIRA from your own blog

Most modern blogging software has the capablity to generate an Atom/RSS feed from post categories or tags. If you blog about risk and want to be included in the SIRA risk blog aggregation, all you need to do is ensure you've got a feed that is risk-centered and submit that feed to us.

We'll review your submission and feed and let you know you're in once it all looks good. While not required, we would appreciate a link back to SIRA on your site to help introduce others to our organization your fellow risk-bloggers.

For examples of other blog aggregation sites, take a look at [r-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) &amp; [StatsBlogs](http://www.statsblogs.com/).

### SIRA Blog Feeds

Each tag and category has it's own feed, but the three Atom feeds most folks will be interested in are:

- The *complete* site content (including the risk blog aggregation feed) : [all.atom.xml](/stg/feeds/all.atom.xml)
- The SIRA News feed which will contain all official Board, SIRAcon & iRMBOK news: [news.atom.xml](/stg/feeds/category/news.atom.xml)
- The risk aggregator combined feed [riskblog.atom.xml](/stg/feeds/category/riskblog.atom.xml)
