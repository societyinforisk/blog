The Information Risk Management Body of Knowledge (iRMBOK&trade;) is a standard for the practice of information risk management. The iRMBOK&trade; Guide describes information risk management tasks and the knowledge required to be effective.

The primary goal of the iRMBOK&trade; Guide is to define the emerging profession of information risk management. It serves as a baseline that practitioners can agree upon in order to discuss the work they do and to ensure that they have the skills they need to effectively perform the role, and defines the skills and knowledge that people who work with and employ information risk managers should expect a skilled practitioner to demonstrate. It is a framework that describes the information risk management tasks that must be performed in order to understand how an organization may manage its information risks.

The iRMBOK&trade; Guide also provides and promotes a common vocabulary within the information risk management profession for discussing information risk management concepts. 

The Society for Information Risk Analysts (SIRA) views the iRMBOK&trade; Guide as a foundational information risk management reference for its planned professional development programs and certification.
