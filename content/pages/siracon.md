The conference will be held in the loft and auditorium spaces of the Madison Building, winner of a 2015 "Outstanding Building of the Year" Award from the International Building Owners and Managers Association. The Quicken Loans family of companies acquired the Madison Building in 2011 and completely renovated it, attracting new businesses and energy to our bustling urban core. Check out photos of the space at [www.eventsatmadison.com](http://www.eventsatmadison.com). The Madison Building is located at 1555 Broadway in the heart of downtown Detroit.
