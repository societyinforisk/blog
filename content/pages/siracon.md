The Society of Information Risk Analysts (SIRA) is dedicated to continually improving the practice of information risk analysis. We endeavor to do this by supporting the collaborative efforts of our members through research, knowledge sharing, and member-driven education.

Since the whole of SIRA will always be greater than the sum of its parts, we value, above all else, the participation of our members. We understand that it is their willingness to contribute openly and constructively that will help the society reach its mission of continual improvement. To that end, SIRA promotes the collaborative efforts if its members by offering a variety of connection methods, online and off, print and electronic, challenging traditional limitations with new technology and passion.

The current management structure of SIRA consists of seven elected board members.

Our primary mode of communication with each other is the mailing list. You can join that list here: <a href="http://lists.societyinforisk.org/mailman/listinfo/sira">SIRA Mailing List</a> to get involved.

SIRA also has a pretty active blog that you can reach via the navigation tabs above this text.
