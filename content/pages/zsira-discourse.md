We're happy to announce the launch of the [SIRA Discourse](https://discourse.societyinforisk.org/), our all new member's only discussion forum. While we're keeping the general e-mail list going, we wanted to create a place where members could have rich collaboration and foster communication through a community-moderated platform.

The SIRA Discourse features:

- general posting
- threaded replies
- file linking and content embedding, and
- will still work with plain ol' e-mail if you still want to use that as your primary way of engaging with the member community.

There are plenty of starter topics to jump in on and members are encouraged to start new ones and join in the discussion on them all. For all the _lurkers_ out there, now's your chance to become part of the conversation.

As an extra bonus, we've added all the content from SIRAcon 2014 and the inaugural webinar featuring Jack Jones & Jack Freund.

There are plenty of places in the SIRA Discourse to leave feedback and engage directly with the Board. 

We encourge folks to help us kick the tyres, suggest new features and file bug reports as you come across things that just don't look right.
