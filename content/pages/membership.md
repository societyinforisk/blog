The SIRA Board of Directors passed a resolution to start a new paid membership tier based upon the results of this year's membership survey and the desire to create the foundation for a more formal professional organization. As a result, we are formally announcing the introduction of the SIRA Professional Membership (SPM).

The cost for SPM will be **$50.00USD**. SIRA will maintain current and historical records of your membership in the event you reference SPM on your CV/bio/resume. Benefits to membership include:

- Reduced registration to SIRAcon ($50.00 off total price)
- Membership through 2014
- Proceedings of 2013 SIRAcon
- SIRAcon journal subscription carried through 2014
- Free access to SIRA-sponsored webinars

Future webinars will be restricted to SPM or those paying to attend.

>NOTE: The [mailing list](http://lists.societyinforisk.org/mailman/listinfo/sira) is still open to all with no cost to access/participate.
