<p><em><strong>Is your Organization ready for a risk management program?</strong></em></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43620382">SIRACon: Bob Rudis, &quot;Is your Organization ready for a risk management program?&quot;</a>.<br />
	Cyber Risk Management may be the new &#39;black&#39; in infosec, but just how ready is your organization to adopt a comprehensive information [cyber] risk management program? Understanding where you are now is critical, because you can&#39;t just go from 0-OCTAVE in 5 seconds. After this talk, you should be able to analyze the gaps in your current organization, start framing even the most compliance-driven program in basic risk terms and gradually move from reactionary spend to qualitative/quantitative-based prioritization. Surprisingly, you may find you actually do have a risk management program and just need to help it grow and mature.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43620383">SIRACon: David Seibert, &quot;Risk Management from an Enterprise Risk Management Perspective&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>This session will cover the objectives of ERM and how it has been implemented at Affinity Plus. Along the way we will discuss real situations regarding Board reporting, risk identification and assessment techniques, risk profile exercises, and the need for continual improvement along the risk management maturity curve. Additionally, risk management programs need to be tailored to the business. Affinity Plus is a Not-for-profit 501(c)(1) cooperative entity, a &ldquo;challenger brand&rdquo; from a brand perspective, and has a unique business model relative to typical financial institutions. See how these are addressed.<br />
	<strong>David Seibert </strong>is the Risk Management Officer at Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union, Minnesota&rsquo;s largest state-based credit union. Here Mr. Seibert is building the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program designed to ensure that the credit union has a current, correct and comprehensive understanding of its risks and that these risks are managed to within the Board&rsquo;s appetite. David has over 10 years of experience in risk management and information security in various industries and 7 years of financial analysis experience in the municipal bond industry and holds a BS and an MBA in finance from the Carlson School of Management.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Base Rate Fallacy: How Fourfold Tables can help in Information Security</strong></em></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/43643478">SIRACon: Patrick Florer, &quot;The Base Rate Fallacy: How Fourfold Tables can help in Information Security&quot;</a></p>
<p>A Fourfold table, also called a 2 x 2 table or matrix, is a four cell table (2 rows x 2 columns) based upon two sets of dichotomous or &rdquo;yes/no&rdquo; facts. Understanding how to construct and use these tables helps us understand the correct probabilities of True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, and False Negative events. Understanding these probabilities enables us to understand the claims of many types of security technologies, including the effectiveness of antivirus software, web application scanners, and IDS/IPS systems.<br />

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/44540878">SIRACon: Jay Jacobs, &quot;OpenPERT: Modeling Expert Opinion&quot;</a></p>
<p>In a world struggling for quality data, sometimes the best data available to analysts is the opinion of subject matter experts. Being able to collect and quantify expert opinion can improve analysis and push data collection within information security towards a more repeatable process.  This presentation will cover the collection of opinion and analysis techniques with the OpenPERT tool, an open-source project.</p>

<p><em><strong>Organizing Risk Management Programs, or, What I Learned from the Secret Service and the Aviation Industry</strong></em><br />

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/44519848">SIRACon: John Benninghoff, &quot;Organizing Risk Management Programs, or, What I Learned from...&quot;</a></p>
<p>Effective, established Risk Management practices fall into two major categories: management of risk due to accidental damage (safety) and management of risk due to threats (protection). This talk will present the case that these are two distinct methodologies, and all information risk management should be divided into protection functions (like the Secret Service) and safety functions (like the Airline Industry), staffed by different people if possible, due to the differences in approach, available data, threat behavior, and the cognitive biases of the risk analysts themselves.<br />
	<strong>John Benninghoff </strong>started his information security career when he was asked to build and deploy a Network IDS using free software (SHADOW and OpenBSD) after returning from a SANS conference in 1998. John has worked as a network security engineer, security architect, and senior manager, and now provides consulting services through his company, Transvasive Security. John holds CISSP and CISM Certifications, and received the CISM Worldwide Excellence Award for earning the top score on the December 2005 CISM Exam.</p>

<p><em><strong>Rolling with Resistance: Because Risk Management Isn&rsquo;t Just About Being Right</strong></em><br />

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/44519847">SIRACon: Evan Wheeler, Rachel Friendly, &quot;Rolling with Resistance: Because Risk Management Isn&rsquo;t Just About Being Right&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>It can be challenging to have patience with someone when they just don&rsquo;t seem to &ldquo;get it&rdquo; why can&rsquo;t they see the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to proceed? Motivational Interviewing (MI; e.g., Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002) is a technique that was originally developed to help substance abuse counselors increase motivation for change in their clients by focusing on collaboration (versus confrontation), evocation (versus imposition of ideas), and autonomy (versus authority). This presentation leverages the principles of Motivational Interviewing and the Stages of Change model (Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1982) to communicate more effectively with management. Discussion will focus on the reasons that many common ways of presenting risk information or methodologies may meet with resistance from senior management, as well as suggestions for ways to approach these conversations that will increase the chances of your message being heard, internalized, and integrated into organizational culture. These techniques will enable you to move your risk program in a direction that might not yet be clear to the organization, without alienating the senior leadership. <br />

<p><em><strong>I am a better Security Pr​o because I am an Investor &amp; I am a better Investor Because I am a Security Pro. - Why investing is important, and why Security Pros are uniquely suited to it</strong></em></p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="375" mozallowfullscreen="" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/44530071" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/44530071">SIRACon: Gunnar Peterson, &quot;I am a better Security Pr​o because I am an Investor &amp; I am a better Investor Because I am...&quot;</a>.<br />
	Effective information security and investing require similar skills - risk management is the obvious one but it goes way deeper. Good investors foster a defensive mindset - they know they are playing a losers game. Investors deal with data ( but only to a point) - investors have great historical data and next to nothing about the future risks - sound familiar? &quot;Hacking the system&quot; mentality pays off - good investors find obscure features nobody cares to see and figure out how to exploit it.<br />
	This is an informal session, really focused on mindset and personal/professional development with lots of time for Q&amp;A and open discussion. Some of the benefits to security pros learning about investing include - on a personal level making money (always welcome), but really we&#39;re used to thinking in terms of pensions and this is no longer the case. Most everyone will need to manage their own retirement, start now; there is a professional benefit in the sense that once you understand the capital dynamics of certain business decisions that formerly made zero sense become crystal clear with an capital allocation hat on.</p>
