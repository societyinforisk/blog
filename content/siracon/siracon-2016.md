# Why should YOU present at SIRAcon?

Information Risk Management is what we do. It's what we think about, talk about, dream about, and love to hear new ideas about. If you're obsessed with finding a better way to measure and manage information risk, SIRAcon is the place to be. You'll find yourself among a community of supportive peers who are eager to help you further develop your ideas. So come join the fun and show us what you've got!

# What should YOU present?

Submitted topics should represent original works and be of interest to the SIRA membership. Real-life case studies (redacted/anonymized as needed) are generally preferred over more theoretical discussions, but all topics will be considered. Established and new presenters are all encouraged to respond. Please indicate whether your session will be a lecture, group discussion, demonstration, etc.

Suggested topics include (but are not limited to):

- Building a risk management program
- Successes/challenges with a risk assessment framework
- Regulations and standards within risk analysis
- Risk communication/perception
- The joy of using math to analyze risk
- The pitfalls of not using math to analyze risk
- Some variation of the last two
- Risk aggregation across multiple analytic efforts
- Cyber insurance
- Economic influences within risk management
