If you're reading this and have been involved with SIRA for any length of time, you'll notice that we've given the old website (and logo) a bit of a facelift.

The new site should be responsive across all your devices and we would appreciate any feedback, suggestions or bug-reports you may have, which you can leave via our new [feedback form](https://www.societyinforisk.org/pages/contact-feedback.html).

For those who want some of the gory, technical details, we moved off of Drupal and are using a Python-based static website generator called ([Pelican](http://getpelican.com)), which is backed by content managed on [github](https://github.com/societyinforisk/blog). That means no more logins for folks (at least on the web site), but it also means even more flexibility and greater security (no more PHP!). We've moved about 50% of the older content over to the new format and are continuing to convert the remaining posts to the new site format. The old Drupal site/database is around if anyone needs any content from it. Ping [Bob Rudis](mailto:bob@rudis.net) if you need anything.

### Community Risk Blog
One new component of the site is the aggregated "Risk Blog". If you maintain a blog that has an Atom/RSS feed of "risk-oriented" posts, head on over to [https://www.societyinforisk.org/pages/blog.html](https://www.societyinforisk.org/pages/blog.html) and register it! We'll re-blog all your risky content on the SIRA site, giving you greater exposure and providing a one-stop-resource for some of the best information risk content on the internet. More info on "re-blogging" at the aforementioned link.

### iRMBOK Micro-site Coming Soon!
The iRMBOK team is hard at work updating the body of knowledge and we're creating a special micro-site just for them. Keep watching the list and this site for updates.
