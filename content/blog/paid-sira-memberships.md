The SIRA Board of Directors passed a resolution at their most recent meeting to start a new paid membership tier based upon the results of this year's membership survey and the desire to create the foundation for a more formal professional organization. As a result, we are formally announcing the introduction of the SIRA Professional Membership (SPM).

The cost for SPM will be $50.00USD. SIRA will maintain current and historical records of your membership in the event you reference SPM on your CV/bio. Benefits to membership include:

  * Reduced registration to SIRAcon ($50.00 off total price)
  * Membership through 2014
  * Proceedings of 2013 SIRAcon
  * SIRAcon journal subscription carried through 2014
  * Free access to SIRA-sponsored webinars 

Future webinars will be restricted to SPM or those paying to attend.
