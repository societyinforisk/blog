This week, San Francisco’s Moscone center and surrounding neighborhood will be bursting at the seams, full of security professionals from around the world. That’s right, [RSA 2015](http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15) and [BSides SF](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/90944586/BSidesSF2015) are right around the corner, and leaders from the Society of Information Risk Analysts (SIRA) will be on hand to give their perspective on the current workings and future opportunities in risk management, data-driven security, and leveraging analytics, metrics, and machine learning to improve defenses. 

Alex Hutton (SIRA co-founder, @[alexhutton](http://twitter.com/alexhutton)) and David Mortman (SIRA member, @[mortman](http://twitter.com/mortman)) will be unveiling the results of their recent project in "[Cookin' Up Metrics With Alex and David: A Recipe For Success!](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15/agenda/sessions/1601/cookin-up-metrics-with-alex-and-david-a-recipe-for)". Today’s information security pros know that being able to measure performance is key to being successful; and while effective metrics are a critical tool, badly designed metrics can become the bane of your existence. Alex and David will share their experience about the ingredients in useful, usable metrics and how to pull together a great scorecard that helps tell and sell the right story back into your organization. As SIRA inspiration Galileo Galilei said, information risk professionals need to _"...measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so."_ Tasting menu (aka preview of their slides) is available [here](https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/dsp-t09-cookin-up-metrics-with-alex-and-david-a-recipe-for-success.pdf). 

Fresh off the release of this year’s [Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report](http://verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2015), SIRA Directors Bob Rudis (SIRA Director of R Evangelism/Technology, @[hrbrmstr](http://twitter.com/hrbrmstr)) and Jay Jacobs (SIRA Vice President - @[jayjacobs](http://twitter.com/jayjacobs)) will share their experiences working as data scientists in security in "[Security Data Science: From Theory to Reality](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15/agenda/sessions/1672/security-data-science-from-theory-to-reality)". Attendees of this talk will gain a perspective on how to ask the right questions in their organization to begin or continue their journey into data-driven security. Come for the data science, stay for the animations.

Jay and Bob will also be presenting findings from the DBIR specifically on Tuesday. The SIRA mailing list has been hosting lively discussions on this year’s report, and one of our favorite "better than an executive summary" views on the report is [here](http://www.zdnet.com/article/verizon-android-is-a-mess-but-the-mobile-malware-epidemic-is-a-myth/), from @[violetblue](http://twitter.com/violetblue) over at ZDNet.

If you're looking specifically for fellow SIRA folks, a good place to stop by is the "[Advancing Information Risk Practices Seminar](http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us14/agenda/sessions/912/advancing-information-risk-practices-seminar)" happening on Monday 1:00-4:30 pm in West 3018. There’s a great lineup of topics and an all-star cast of speakers, including key contributors to the SIRA community like David Musselwhite, Evan Wheeler, and Michael Werneburg. _"Information security is evolving, and we are seeing security practitioners becoming more interested in the quantitative techniques pioneered in the risk community,"_ commented Allison Miller, President of SIRA’s Board of Directors (@[selenakyle](http://twitter.com/selenakyle)), "it’s a promising trend, and we at SIRA hope to see even more research and innovation happening in this area."

The [Society of Information Risk Analysts](http://societyinforisk.org) (SIRA), established in 2011, is the go-to resource for decision makers and practitioners of information risk management. SIRA provides a forum where members can exchange ideas and insights in risk science, explore new methods for managing information risk, and build meaningful, professional relationships with other leaders. In addition, SIRA hosts a public email list for 600+ subscribers, where risk research and philosophy are actively debated by some of the most seasoned professionals in our discipline.
