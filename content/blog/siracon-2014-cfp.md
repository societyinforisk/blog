The **third annual SIRAcon** will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota on **Thursday and Friday, October 9th and 10th, 2014**. We invite you to share your expertise!

#### WHY SHOULD I PRESENT AT SIRACON?

If you have attended past SIRACons then you already know - SIRACon is unlike any other security or privacy conference. 
Information Risk Management is all we do. 

It's what we think about, talk about, and like to hear about. 

It's what we are striving to do better. 

Once a year, SIRACon gives us an opportunity to get together and share our ideas and experiences with the rest of the SIRA community.
 
If you haven't yet attended a SIRACon, make 2014 your year. We want to meet **you** in person. 

More than that, we want to learn from you. If you are an information risk analyst, security practitioner, risk manager, researcher or any other risk specialist, we encourage you to submit a topic and present at the conference.

#### WHAT SHOULD I PRESENT?

Submitted topics should represent original works and be of interest to the SIRA membership. Topics from the “front lines” are generally preferred over more theoretical discussions but all topics will be considered.  Established and new presenters are all encouraged to respond. 

Suggested topics include (but are not limited to):

- Building a risk management program
- Successes/challenges with a risk assessment framework
- Regulations and standards within risk analysis
- Risk communication/perception
- The joy of using math to analyze risk
- The pitfalls of not using math to analyze risk
- Some variation of the last two
- Risk aggregation across multiple analytic efforts
- Cyber insurance
- Economic influences within risk management

#### HOW DO I SUBMIT A TOPIC?

Submitting a topic is EASY. Just [complete the form](https://docs.google.com/a/societyinforisk.org/forms/d/1Aan7Qc90xpru97LI-1VbcHMPRPO_TI73zlUJn1atNUk/viewform)!
