Information Risk Management is what we do. It's what we think about, talk about, dream about, and love to hear new ideas about. If you're obsessed with finding a better way to measure and manage information risk, SIRAcon is the place to be. You'll find yourself among a community of supportive peers who are eager to help you further develop your ideas.
