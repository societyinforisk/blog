Social media and online interaction are dramatically changing the way our companies and employees interface with society at large.  Recent examples of people tweeting or posting something silly or offensive and being responded to by doxxing or even threats of physical abuse are, unfortunately, becoming more common.   

Today we (SIRA member Alex Hutton and Ian Amit) are publicly announcing an open (free as in speech, free as in beer) project to help security departments identify social media presences that are more "at risk" to negative reactions.  This framework of indicators is a little something we're calling "Social Media Risk Metrics" (catchy, right?).  SMRM is being introduced at Derbycon today complete with a demonstration, worksheet tool, and suggestions for further development.
