If you are involved with risk management, we’d appreciate you taking the time to complete the survey, which may be accessed here. 

This survey will remain open until October 15, and we'd appreciate your help in promoting it to others in the risk community. If there are others in your organization who are involved in risk management, we’d greatly appreciate you forwarding this to them for completion.

The output of this survey will be a free whitepaper published jointly by The Open Group and SIRA that describes risk management practices in enterprise organizations.
