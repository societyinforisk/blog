In this, the first podcast for the Society of Information Risk Analysts (SIRA), Alex, Chris, John and Jay talk with David Mortman. We intended this to be a quick chat to prime the RSS feed, but we ended up covering some good points around risk management. We also talked about ERM being referred to as a ""cool toy" for companies. While some of us failed to find the mute button we were still able to record this without too many problems.
