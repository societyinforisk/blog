Recently, our editors revealed the final version of the book cover and indicated that its okay to share with you. So here it is: the official cover of *Measuring and Managing Information Risk: A FAIR Approach*. As soon as we get a publication date we will be happy to share. Tentatively we are looking at late this Summer or early Fall.

(Note: I’m not sure but the actual cover may vary from this as we go through the production process).
