As most people in our profession prepare for the annual trek to Las Vegas, 3/4ths of us on the Risk Science podcast are not.  In this episode, Ally, Alex, Chris and Jay discuss Ally’s experience at the WEIS conference (<http://weis2014.econinfosec.org/>) then slide into the NIST Cyber Security Framework (again), and tackle a few listener questions.
