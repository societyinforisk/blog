In my January column for @ISACA I talk about the use of a improv technique called “yes, and…” that you can read about [here](http://www.isaca.org/About-ISACA/-ISACA-Newsletter/Pages/at-ISACA-Volume-2-15-January-2014.aspx#3).

The idea is to keep the improv scene going as long as possible by working with your partner versus opposing them. If they propose something, no matter how outlandish, you assume its valid and work with it. This gives you the opportunity to redirect the outcome. However, if you shut down the scene and attempt to wrestle control away from your partner, the scene gets awkward and if you do it enough they tend to not want to work with you anymore.

It’s a metaphor you see: work with the business on their initiatives and you get invited back to the table.
