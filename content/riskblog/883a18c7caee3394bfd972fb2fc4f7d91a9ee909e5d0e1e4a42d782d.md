With the recent release of the [Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/) (DBIR) we invited Wade Baker, the godfather of the DBIR, onto the podcast.  Alex and Allison were able to ask questions of Wade and Jay about the DBIR. We wrap things up talking about Allison’s paper being accepted at WEIS.
