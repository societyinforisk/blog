I had an article published in the November issue of the ISSA journal by the same name as this blog post.  I’ve got permission to post it to a personal webpage, so [it is now available here.](http://beechplane.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/a-call-to-arms_issa1111.pdf) 

The article begins with a quote:

> When we take action on the basis of an [untested] belief, we destroy the chance to discover whether that belief is appropriate. – Robin M. Hogarth

That quote from his book, “[Educating Intuition](http://www.amazon.com/Educating-Intuition-Robin-M-Hogarth/dp/0226348628)” and it really caught the essence of what I see as the struggles in information security.  We are making security decisions based on what we believe and then we move onto the Next Big Thing without seeking adequate feedback.  This article is an attempt to say that whatever you think of the “[quant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analyst)” side of information security needs to be compared to the what we have without quants – which is an intuitive approach.  What I’ve found in preparing for this article is that the environment we work in is not conducive to developing a trustworthy intuition on its own.  As a result, we have justification in challenging unaided opinion when it comes to risk-based decisions and we should be building feedback loops into our environment.

Have a read.  And by all means, feedback is not only sought, it is required.
