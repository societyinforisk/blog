Recently Ben Rothke named *Measuring and Managing Information Risk* as the [Best Book of 2014](http://www.rsaconference.com/blogs/the-best-information-security-book-of-2014-and-some-other-excellent-ones). Frankly, I’m humbled by this as the field of competitors we are named amongst are very strong; Adam Shostack’s book was even [named as best of 2014 by the venerable Bruce Schneier.](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/11/adam_shostacks_.html)
