Please join me in a webinar on risk management where I’ll pull back the covers and discuss a component of the FAIR framework that hasn’t been shared publicly before.

Although FAIR is primarily known as a framework for quantifying risk, other parts of the framework focus on understanding how to manage risk more effectively.  In this webinar I’ll describe the Visibility Analysis component of the framework and how it can provide a source of meaningful metrics and intelligence that helps organizations approach risk more strategically.  To learn more and to sign up for the webinar, please go [here](http://www.businessofsecurity.com/eventpage6.html).

The webinar will take place on November 17th, at 11:30 am Eastern U.S. time.

Hope you can join us.
