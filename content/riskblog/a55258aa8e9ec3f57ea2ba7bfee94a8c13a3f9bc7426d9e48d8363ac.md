Jack Jones wrote a [blog  post](http://www.elsevier.com/connect/how-to-prove-your-value-in-information-security) for our publisher’s site about why its important to justify security spend, and how the industry is at a turning point about that.

 

Also,  another quick note: it seems that the book is available on [Google  Play](http://books.google.com/books/about/Measuring_and_Managing_Information_Risk.html?id=oAR0AwAAQBAJ) in eBook format (scanned pages; not reflow like you’d get on Kindle).
