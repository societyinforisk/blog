I participated in my second [risk management podcast for the Open Group](http://blog.opengroup.org/2013/07/09/the-open-group-july-conference-emphasizes-value-of-placing-structure-and-agility-around-enterprise-risk-reduction-efforts/) that was published today. I like this one better than my [previous one](http://riskdr.com/2013/02/15/opengroup-risk-mgmt-podcast/)–I tried to talk slower in this one anyways  ;-)

I was happy with the topics that we discussed, most notably that as regulators become more aware of the capabilities of quantitative risk assessment techniques they will begin demanding them from those they are reviewing. Of course, Jack and Jim were great as well and the conversation was expertly moderated by Dana.
