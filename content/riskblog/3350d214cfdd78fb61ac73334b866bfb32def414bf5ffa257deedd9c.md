My @ISACA column for November was published recently. You can read it [here](http://www.isaca.org/About-ISACA/-ISACA-Newsletter/Pages/at-ISACA-Volume-24-20-November-2013.aspx#2).

This was a tough one to write, and not just due to the 200 word max limitation (which I still exceeded). Overall, lots of security professions tend to (I believe) unknowingly speak ill of the management of the companies for which they work. It’s second nature to think that your judgement about security overrides whatever else management is doing. My point with this column was to help people see that risk management defines priority across the organization; in other words, I’m sure that marketing, accounting, sales, etc. think that whatever they are working on is far more important than what security is doing. Thinking about these priorities through a risk lens helps people level-set their work against the rest of the company’s work. I use an outraged “author’s voice” to wake people up to what they are saying and how they express it.

This was difficult to write primarily because I didn’t want to insult anybody, but to also help people understand that the words they use, even amongst other security professionals, are not productive in improving relationships within the rest of the company.
