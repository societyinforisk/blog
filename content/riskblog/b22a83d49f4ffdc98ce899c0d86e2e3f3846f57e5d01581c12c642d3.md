The wait is over! The definitive guide to using FAIR in your daily risk work is now for sale everywhere you care to buy books (which in today’s book business means Amazon, Google, etc.). It’s available in soft cover if you want a physical book and also on eBook. There are a few reviews out there on Amazon, but I received this message today that really humbled me:

> Thank you for the book. It’s the largest conversation-starter piece I’ve seen in my entire career.

I’m so grateful to have made something that others find useful. Please keep sending me your thoughts and opinions on the book and also any questions you may have on how to use it. That’s really what Jack and I wanted to make — a practical guide to applying the FAIR model to help with risk decision making. I’d love to hear how it has helped you.
