Today an article I worked with help from Kevin Chalk was published in the [ISSA Journal](http://www.issa.org/?page=ISSAJournal). When I am able, I will post the text here for review. It should be in your inbox if you prefer to read e-versions of articles. Not sure when they get mailed out.

Itâ€™s a great piece on how to apply some soft skills (and some decidedly not so soft skills) in the furtherance of conducting a supplier review. You will never know as much about the supplier as they know about themselves, so this is a good approach to trying to uncover where there may be a lack of truthfulness in certain responses.

We wrote about using the [Reid Technique](http://www.reid.com/), which is a standard in law enforcement interviewing and interrogation. Its worth exploring to see if it fits into your own security and risk program.
