It’s been a while since all four of us have been together and Alex catches us up on his travels and a recent hire worthy of mentioning.  Jay talk more about the [book he’s working on with Bob Rudis](http://amzn.to/ddsec) (amzn.to/ddsec) . Jay also has an article out with Marcus Ranum at <http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/opinion/New-measures-for-security-metrics-Ranum-QA-with-Jay-Jacobs>.

We wrap this up with a healthy debate on the semantics of “prediction” versus “forecasting”.
