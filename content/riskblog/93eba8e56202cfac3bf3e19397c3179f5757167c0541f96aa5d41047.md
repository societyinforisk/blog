Metricon 6 was held in San Francisco, CA on August 9th, 2011. A few months ago, I and a few others were asked by the conference chair – Mr. Alex Hutton (@alexhutton) – to assist in the planning and organization of the conference. One of the goals established early-on was that this Metricon needed to be different then previous Metricon events. Having attended Metricon 5, I witnessed firsthand the inquisitive and skeptical nature of the conference attendees towards speakers and towards each other. So, one of our goals for Metricon 6 was to change the culture of the conference. In my opinion, we succeeded in doing that by establishing topics that would draw new speakers and strike a happy balance between metrics, security and information risk management.

Following are a few Metricon 6 after-thoughts…

**Venue:** This was my first non-military trip to San Francisco. I loved the city! The vibe was awesome! The sheer number of people made for great people-watching entertainment and so many countries / cultures were represented everywhere I went. It gave a whole new meaning to America being a melting pot of the world.

**Speakers:** We had some great speakers at Metricon. Every speaker did well, the audience was engaged, and while questions were limited due to time – they took some tough questions and dealt with them appropriately.

**Favorite Sessions**: Three of the 11 sessions stood out to me:

Jake Kouns – Cyber Insurance. I enjoyed this talk for a few reasons: a. it is an area of interest I have and b. the talk was easy to understand. I would characterize it as an overview of what cyber insurance is [should be] as well as some of the some of the nuances. Keeping in mind it was an overview – commercial insurance policies can be very complex – especially for large organizations. Some organizations do not buy separate “cyber insurance” policies – but utilize their existing policies to cover potential claims / liability arising from operational information technology failures or other scenarios. Overall – Jake is offering a unique product and while I would like to know more details – he appears to be well positioned in the cyber insurance product space.

Allison Miller / Itai Zukerman – Operationalizing Analytics. Alli and Itai went from 0 to 60 in about 5 seconds. They presented some work that brought together data collection, modeling and analysis- in less then 30 minutes. Itai was asked a question about the underlying analytical engine used – and he just nonchalantly replied ‘I wrote it in Java myself’ – like it was no big deal. That was hot.

Richard Lippman – Metrics for Continuous Network Monitoring. Richard gave us a glimpse of a real-time monitoring application; specifically, tracking un-trusted devices on protected subnets. The demo was very impressive and probably gave a few in the room some ‘metrigasms’ (I heard this phrase from @mrmeritology).

**People**: All the attendees and speakers were cordial and professional. By the end of the day – the sense of community was stronger then what we started with. A few quick shout-outs:

Behind-the-scenes contributors / organizers. The Usenix staff helped us out a lot over the last few months. We also had some help from Richard Baker who performed some site reconnaissance in an effort to determine video recording / video streaming capabilities – thank you sir. There were a few others that helped in selecting conference topics – you know who you are – thank you!

@chort0 and his lovely fiancé Meredith. They pointed some of us to some great establishments around Union Square. Good luck to the two of you as you go on this journey together.

@joshcorman. I had some great discussion with Josh. While we have only known each other for a few months – he has challenged me to think about questions [scenarios] that no one else is addressing.

+Wendy Nather. Consummate professional. Wendy and I have known of each other for a few years but never met in person prior to Metricon6. We had some great conversation; both professional and personal. She values human relationships and that is more important in my book then just the social networking aspect.

@alexhutton & @jayjacobs – yep – it rocked. Next… ?

**All the attendees**. Without attendance, there is no Metricon. The information sharing, hallway collaboration and presentation questions contributed greatly to the event. Thank you!

\*\*\*

So there you go everyone! It was a great event! Keep your eyes and ears open for information about the next Metricon. Consider reanalyzing your favorite conferences and if you are looking for small, intimate and stimulating conferences – filled with thought leadership and progressive mindsets – give Metricon a chance!
