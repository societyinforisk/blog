I came up with something useful to post about the other day, only to wonder whether I’d already posted about it sometime ago.  (It turns out I had, mostly.)  But in the search through past posts, three things became clear:

-   I really haven’t had that many posts.  Alex was prolific, and Jack Freund and Ryan have added some excellent ones too
-   I needed a simple reference so that I could avoid repeating myself on topics
-   There doesn’t appear to be a simple way for someone to find my past posts

So, I decided to put all of my past posts (at least the ones I thought were decent) into a single reference .  I’ve posted [that reference](http://riskmanagementinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/To-Be-FAIR-About-It-v1.pdf) to the resources page of the RMI website in case someone (my family, maybe) wanted to browse my past posts without digging through an entire blog site.  In case you’re wondering, it contains only twenty-five posts.  Twenty-five out of a total 388 posts to-date on this site.

Don’t, however, think for a moment that these represent the best posts on this site.  They aren’t — not by a long shot.  They’re just the ones I’ve contributed.
