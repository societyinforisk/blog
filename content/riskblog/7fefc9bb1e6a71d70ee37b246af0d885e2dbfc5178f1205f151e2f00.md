![img](http://riskdr.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/11871-albert_anker-the_town_clerk-1874.jpg?w=230&h=288)Earlier this year my good friend [Jack Jones](http://riskmanagementinsight.com/riskanalysis/) and I entered into a contract with [Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com/) imprint [Butterworth-Heinemann](http://store.elsevier.com/Butterworth-heinemann/IMP_30/) to write a book on the risk assessment methodology [FAIR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis_of_information_risk). We will deliver the final manuscript in the fist quarter of 2014 and it should be in print next summer/fall. The title of the book is tentatively called ***Measuring and Managing Information Risk: A FAIR Approach***.

It is a real honor to be able to write about a topic I love with the industry visionary that taught me how to do it.

From the beginning, when Jack and I first began talking about this book (over dinner in the early summer of 2012) we wanted to write a conversational book to teach risk practitioners how to do FAIR. We didn’t want to write a risk textbook, and to be sure this is not a math book. It is very much intended to be an accessible book to help people understand how to take the work they are currently doing in risk management and improve the results quickly using applied methods and techniques. And don’t worry: our trademark senses of humor will be firmly intact throughout (my tongue always seems to be firmly ensconced in my cheek).

This book has been a long time coming. FAIR has evolved significantly since Jack Jones [first published the FAIR whitepaper in 2005](http://riskmanagementinsight.com/media/documents/FAIR_Introduction.pdf). Jack and I have conducted numerous FAIR training sessions and classes that detail the evolution of this now [industry standard](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919899/toc.pdf), but one thing is still a challenge for many people: how to apply FAIR to the daily security scenarios with which they are faced. This book will describe various scenarios to help lift the fog and give people “Ah-Ha” moments as they will quickly find examples that emulate current scenarios they are facing, or application techniques they can use to help better model the risk they are currently modeling in FAIR. We are even taking it further by showing you how to present risk scenarios to management and how to integrate FAIR into many popular risk assessment standards (NIST, ISO, etc.).

When you are done reading this book, you will know how to apply FAIR anywhere to model the risk associated with virtually anything. And it will also be a great reference for those looking to earn the Open Group’s upcoming FAIR Risk Analyst certification.

So naturally writing a book takes a lot of work so that’s why my writing here has been sketchy these past couple months. But in the meantime, you can get a preview of the book at a [blog post](http://www.cxoware.com/groundhog-day-2/) that Jack wrote to better understand the concepts around what risk management is and how to practice it.
