It has been a few years since I updated the “[risk vernacular](http://risktical.wordpress.com/risk-vernacular/)” portion of this blog. Based off some college-level  insurance and risk management courses as well as some work I am doing in the operational risk management space – there are some new terms I wanted to share as well as update some existing terms based off new information / knowledge. If it has been a while since you reviewed the page – take a few minutes to look at the [page](http://risktical.wordpress.com/risk-vernacular/). Enjoy!

BTW, I will be in San Francisco on August 9th and 10th for [Metricon 6](https://www.securitymetrics.org/content/Wiki.jsp?page=Metricon6.0).
