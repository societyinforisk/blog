Finally, after many suggestions to do so, we’ve developed an online community for certified FAIR practitioners.  This is a place for people to ask questions, share challenges and successes, and recommend improvements.  It is also a source of additional documentation, example analyses, and training that aren’t available to the general public.  If you’ve completed FAIR training and passed the certification exam, this will be an excellent resource for taking you to the next level.

You can go [here](http://forum.riskmanagementinsight.com) to register.

If you’ve been using FAIR based on the white paper I published a few years ago, you should seriously consider taking our online training to up your game, learn about how FAIR has evolved, gain access to the most recent version of the FAIRLite tool, and so that you can take part in the online community.

With that and the holidays in mind, we’re offering a special for our online training.  For anyone who signs up for the December 27th session, the fees are reduced by 20% (to \$799).
