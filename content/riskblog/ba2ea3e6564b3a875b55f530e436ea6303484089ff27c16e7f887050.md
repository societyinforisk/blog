Hello everyone!

I thought I’d give you a brief update. I’ve been very quiet here lately as Jack Jones and I made the final push to complete the book. We submitted the completed manuscript on or about Tax Day in April (with so many late nights, its hard to remember exactly when we were done). The next steps include some editing and proofing as we finalize everything for publishing. The expectation is that we will have it published before the end of summer. I’ll keep you informed here as we gain more information.

BTW, in case you didn’t know, Jack Jones has been blogging on the CXOWARE website: <http://www.cxoware.com/blog/>

There is some good content there :-)
