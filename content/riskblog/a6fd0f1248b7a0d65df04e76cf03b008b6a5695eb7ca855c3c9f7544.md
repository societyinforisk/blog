…form of risk professional. I really miss blogging. The last year or so has been a complete gaggle from a relocation and time-management perspective. So naturally, discretionary activities – like blogging – take a back seat. I want to share a few quick thoughts around the topic of transitioning from a pure information technology / information security mindset to a risk management professional mindset.

1. Embrace the Gray Space. Information technology is all about bits, bytes, ones and zeros. Things either work or don’t work; it is either black or white, it is either good or bad – you get the point. In the discipline of risk management we are interested in everything between the two extremes. It is within this space where there is information to allow decision makers to make more well informed decisions.

2. Embrace Uncertainty. Intuitively, the concept of uncertainty is contrary to a lot of information technology concepts. Foundational risk concepts revolve around understanding and managing uncertainty and infusing it into our analysis / conversation with decision makers. There is no reason why this cannot be done within information risk management programs as well.  At first, it may feel awkward as an IT professional to admit to a leader that there is uncertainty inherent within some of the variables included in your analysis. However, what you will find – assuming you can clearly articulate your analysis – is that infusing the topic of uncertainty in your conversations and analysis has indirect benefits. Such an approach implies rigor, maturity and builds confidence with the decision maker.

3. Find New Friends. Notice I did not type find different friends. There is an old adage that goes something to the effect of “you are who you surround yourself with”. Let me change this up: “you are who you are learning from”. You want to learn risk management? Indulge yourself in non-IT risk management knowledge sources, learn centuries old principles of risk management and then begin applying what you have learned to the information technology / information security problem space. Here are just a few places to begin:

a. <https://www.societyinforisk.org/>

b. [Risk Management Magazine](http://www.rmmagazine.com/)

c. [The Risk Management Society](http://www.rims.org)

d. [Property & Casualty  – Enterprise Risk Management](http://www.propertycasualty360.com/Risk/erm?ref=nav)

4. Change Your Thinking. This is going to sound heretical but bear with me. Stop thinking like an IT professional and begin thinking like a business and a risk management professional. Identify and follow the money trails for the various risk management problem spaces you are dealing with. Think like a commercial insurer. An entire industry exists to reduce the uncertainty associated with technology-related, operational risk – when bad things happen. Thus, learn how commercial insurers think so you can manage risk more effectively without having to overspend on third party risk financing products – as well as manage risk in such a way that can tie back to the financials – feelings and emotions. This is why I am so on-board with the AICPCU’s [Associate in Risk Management](http://www.aicpcu.org/comet/programs/arm/arm.htm#tab1)(ARM) professional designation. You can also check out the [FAIR risk measurement](http://www.cxoware.com/what-is-fair/)methodology which is also very useful for associating loss forms to adverse events which can also help tell the story around financial consequences.

5. Don’t Die On That Hill. I have to thank my new boss for this advice. Choose your risk management battles wisely and in the heat of the conversation ask yourself if you need to die on this hill. Not all of our conversations with decision makers, leaders or even between ourselves – as dear colleagues – is easy. It is way too easy for passion to get in the way of progress and influencing. Often, if you find yourself “on the hill” asking if you need to die – something has gone terribly wrong. Instead of dying and ruining a long term relationship – take a few steps back, get more information that will help in the situation, regroup and attack again. This is an example of being a quiet professional.

That is all for now. Take care.
